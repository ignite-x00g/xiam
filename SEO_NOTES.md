# SEO Enhancement Notes

This document outlines important SEO considerations and manual steps required for the Ops Online Solutions website.

## 1. Sitemap (`sitemap.xml`) Updates

### a. Update `lastmod` Dates
The `<lastmod>` dates in `sitemap.xml` for each URL should reflect the actual date the content of that page was last modified. Currently, many are set to a future placeholder date. These need to be updated manually.

**Action:** For each `<url>` entry in `sitemap.xml`, change the content of `<lastmod>YYYY-MM-DD</lastmod>` to the correct last modification date.

### b. Placeholder Pages & Sitemap Accuracy
The sitemap currently lists several pages that do not yet exist (e.g., `about-us.html`, `business-operations.html`, etc.). Listing non-existent pages can be detrimental to SEO.

**Current Action Taken (Temporary):** Due to limitations in programmatically creating placeholder files and updating `lastmod` dates, these non-existent pages have been temporarily removed from `sitemap.xml` to ensure the sitemap is valid and does not point to 404 errors.

**Future Action Required:**
1.  As each planned page (e.g., `about-us.html`, `security.html`, etc.) is created, it should be added back to `sitemap.xml`.
2.  The `<lastmod>` date for these newly added pages should be set to their creation/modification date.
3.  It's recommended to create at least basic placeholder content for these pages as soon as possible. A simple page with a title, header, footer, and a "Page under construction" message is better than a 404.

## 2. General SEO Best Practices
*   Ensure all pages have unique and descriptive `<title>` tags.
*   Ensure all pages have compelling `<meta name="description">` tags.
*   Continue to use and refine structured data (Schema.org markup) where appropriate.
*   Build high-quality backlinks to the site.
*   Monitor website performance (Core Web Vitals) and address any issues.
