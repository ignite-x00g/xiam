This directory is intended to hold the FontAwesome assets used by the site.
Because the Codex environment does not have internet access, the actual FontAwesome
files could not be downloaded automatically. To use FontAwesome icons, download
version 5.15.4 (or the desired release) from https://fontawesome.com and place
`all.min.css` in `assets/fontawesome/css/` and the `webfonts` directory content
in `assets/fontawesome/webfonts/`.
